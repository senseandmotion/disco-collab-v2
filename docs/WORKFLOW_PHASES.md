- **Commenting system** on submitted opportunities
- **Team Lead sets deadline** with reminder notifications
- **Ongoing submissions** - contributors can add opportunities throughout

### AI Integration
- Guide opportunity crafting with contextual questions

## Phase 2: Collaborative Review
**Goal**: AI synthesis + human refinement

### Features
- **AI clusters similar opportunities** and suggests merges
- **Deciders approve/reject** AI recommendations
- **Team discussion and refinement** of opportunities
- **Continuous opportunity addition** as insights emerge

### AI Integration
- Present clustered opportunities to team
- Suggest measurable metrics based on success descriptions
- Facilitate team discussion with prompts

## Phase 3: Prioritization & Decision
**Goal**: Final ranking and export for consultation

### Features
- **AI provides initial ranking** based on previous phases
- **Impact/Effort slider interface** (0-10 scale for each)
- **Real-time grid visualization** of priorities
- **Deciders make final calls** after team input
- **PDF export** of results

### Method: Impact/Effort Matrix
- Contributors rate opportunities on Impact (0-10) and Effort (0-10)
- Visual grid shows distribution across quadrants
- Focus on high-impact, low-effort opportunities
- Deciders finalize priority ranking
