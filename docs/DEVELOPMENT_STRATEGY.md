# Development Strategy

## Approach: Build from Scratch with MUI
**Strategy**: Build native MUI components designed for collaborative workflows

### Phase-by-Phase Development

#### Phase 1: Core Foundation
- [ ] **Session creation interface** - Team Lead creates session
- [ ] **Participant management** - view and assign roles to team members
- [ ] **Basic session state management** with LocalStorage
- [ ] **Simple navigation** between components

#### Phase 2: Opportunity Management
- [ ] **Opportunity submission form** with basic AI integration
- [ ] **Opportunity listing** with real-time updates
- [ ] **Comment system** for team collaboration
- [ ] **Phase transition controls** for Team Lead

#### Phase 3: AI Integration
- [ ] **AI chat component** built with MUI
- [ ] **Clustering/synthesis** functionality
- [ ] **Decider approval workflow** for AI recommendations
- [ ] **Contextual AI prompts** throughout workflow

#### Phase 4: Prioritization & Export
- [ ] **Impact/Effort slider interface**
- [ ] **Priority grid visualization** 
- [ ] **PDF export** functionality
- [ ] **Session completion** workflow

## Key Principles
1. **Build incrementally** - one working feature at a time
2. **Test after each change** - keep builds working
3. **Focus on functionality** for prototype
4. **Use MUI components** consistently throughout
5. **Collaborative-first design** - built for team workflows
